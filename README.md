## Testing

Client side tests - Run `pnpm run test` on the terminal while within the **project root directory**.

Client side testing is achieved through the use of `jest` package and `React testing library`. `jest` is used to test javascript code in ReactReact applications. The React Testing Library is a very light-weight solution for testing React components
